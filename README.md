This real-time tracker project is designed to track the live location of connected users on a map. Each user’s location updates in real-time and is shared with all other users in the application, which is visualized using the Leaflet map library and Socket.IO for WebSocket communication.

### Potential Use Cases for Real-Time Tracker

1. **Fleet and Delivery Management**:
   - This can be useful in logistics, where businesses track the live location of vehicles, delivery drivers, or couriers.
   - The dispatcher can monitor the locations of all active drivers in real-time and provide updates or re-route if needed.

2. **Social or Family Tracking**:
   - This application could be adapted for personal location sharing, allowing friends or family members to share their real-time locations.
   - It could be useful for family outings, group hikes, or social events to keep track of everyone’s location.

3. **Field Service or Employee Tracking**:
   - For businesses with field service employees, like maintenance workers or inspectors, this app could provide visibility into employee locations for optimized dispatching and response times.

4. **Event Management and Safety**:
   - In large events like marathons, parades, or music festivals, organizers could use this app to track event staff, security personnel, or first responders, ensuring they are stationed appropriately or can respond to incidents quickly.

5. **Asset Tracking**:
   - Real-time tracking could be useful for tracking movable assets like rental bikes, scooters, or even items within a warehouse.

6. **Travel Coordination**:
   - Travel companies could use this to share the location of buses or tourist groups, making it easier for tour organizers to manage groups and ensure no one is left behind.

### How It Works

1. **Location Sharing**: 
   - Each connected user’s location is periodically updated and shared with the server via WebSockets.
2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - When a user’s location changes, the server broadcasts this update to all other users, so they see the live movement on the map.
3. **Connection Management**:
   - When a user disconnects, their marker is removed, keeping the map clutter-free.
